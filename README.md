dust texture made by me. ground / sky texture modiified by me but originally created by Clear Code. All other assets (art/sound) made by Clear Code.
This is a follow along of Clear Code's "Ultimate Pygame Introduction" tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk). However, the way I coded it is different enough to be its own thing.
Thanks to Clear Code for the wonderous class on how to use pygame. The zip file is a downloadable build which can be run standalone.
